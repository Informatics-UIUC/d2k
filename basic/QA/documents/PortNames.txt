		Port Names used in D2K

In an attempt to use consistent names for D2K input and output ports (as 
much as is reasonably possible), please consult and update this document
as you update your user modules.   These port names are the input and output 
display names returned by "getInputName()" and "getOutputName()".   Try to 
be consistent when possible so the user isn't overwhelmed with 15 names for
the 'same' information.

Please use the format shown (commas separating different pieces of information)
so that we can sort & manage the information at a later date.  Thanks!
