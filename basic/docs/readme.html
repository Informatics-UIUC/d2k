<h1>D2K Basic 4.1.2</h1>
<p>This is D2K Basic 4.1.2. This version sees a number of changes from the
previous 4.1.1 release. <b>Java 1.5.0 or greater is now required.</b></p>

  D2K Infrastructure:
  <ul>
    <li>Experimental support for SSL sockets with D2K server communications</li>
    <li>Enhancements to ncsa.d2k.batch.BatchInterface
    <ul>
      <li>Documentation</li>
      <li>New methods to make it easier to use</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Libraries that modules depend on can now be located in &lt;d2k home&gt;/lib/ext,
    instead of in the modules directory. Moving libraries out of the modules directory
    speeds up load time</li>
    <li>Enhancements to class loader protocol
    <ul>
      <li>Remote resource loading</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Added removeResource() method to RootModule to remove an object from the
    ResourceManager</li>
    <li>Numerous documentation updates</li>
    <li>HeadlessUIModule: changed supressGui property to suppressGui</li>
    <li>machines.txt (for distributed computing) is now in the D2K install directory
    rather than the user home directory</li>
    <li>Enhancements to nested itineraries:</li>
    <ul>
       <li>Fixed ordering of nested itinerary inputs</li>
       <li>Brushing the ports of a nested itinerary will show the name of the port
           and the name of the module inside that the port comes from</li>
       <li>Fixed bug in which certain nested modules could execute more than once</li>
       <li>Now possible to nest itineraries within other nested itineraries</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  D2K Toolkit:
  <ul>
    <li>Expanded use of anti-aliasing for text</li>
  </ul>

  D2K Basic:
  <ul>
    <li>Moved Column, NumericColumn, TextualColumn interfaces from
    ncsa.d2k.modules.core.datatype.table.basic package to
    ncsa.d2k.modules.core.datatype.table</li>
    <li>Added getTableFactory() to Table interface</li>
    <li>New sparse table implementation in ncsa.d2k.modules.core.datatype.table.sparse2
    package.</li>
    <li>Fix to ChooseAttributes: when attribute names were saved so the module could
    run headless, they were all capitalized. This could cause problems, so the
    capitalization was removed</li>
    <li>Updated the included JUNG and Prefuse libraries.</li>
    <li>Added a number of modules related to Prefuse-based graph visualization.</li>
    <li>Included a Java 3D rule visualization.</li>
                <li>The module ncsa.d2k.modules.core.control.Sink was deprecated and replaced with
                  ncsa.d2k.modules.core.control.DisposeObject                </li>

                <li>ncsa.d2k.modules.core.optimize package was refactored:<BR>
                  The following modules were deprecated and replaced:<BR>
                  <ul>
                  <li>MultiTrainTestBiasEvaluator is replaced with ncsa.d2k.modules.core.optimize.evaluators.ModelingParametersEvaluator                 </li>

    <li>Added reentrant versions of Gate modules</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Changes made in 4.1.1</h2>
<p>D2K Basic 4.1.1 saw several new features introduced since the previous
  4.0.2 release. There has been significant work improving batch mode so that
  this version can run on the batch systems. There have also been significant
  overall improvements in the way nested itineraries are used and edited.</p>
<p>The dialog to update modules, data and itineraries no longer exits. Now the
  modules, data files and itineraries are always installed if an update is available.</p>
<p>The D2K properties file in no longer read from the users home directory at
  all. It is always read from the directory where the application exists.</p>
<p>There is a new Auto Checkpointing feature that will allow a user to set up
  an automatic checkpoint. The user will specify a number of minutes between checkpoints,
  and as nearly as possible, the itinerary execution will pause, checkpoint and
  continue. This occurs automatically.</p>
<p>Nested itinerarys have changed significantly. Now, nested itineraries can behave
  like ReentrantComputeModules. They can clone themselves and execute in parallel
  on different parcels of data. There is a property of the nested itinerary module
  that will enable this feature. The user specifies the number of copies of the
  itinerary to create, and the system does the rest.</p>
<p>Also, nested itinerary editing has changed. Now nested itineraries appear in
  the same window as the outter itinerary. Many bugs in working with deeply nested
  itineraries has also been fixed.</p>
<p>Logging is now fully supported in D2K. If you change the logging level in the
  preferences, the changes take effect immediately, there is no need to restart
  D2K.</p>
<p>There is an editor included for the &quot;machines.txt&quot; file. Recall,
  this file defines what machines are available for distributed computing if the
  Jini URL is set to test.</p>
<p>There is a new feature (as of B3) where a module enables as the result of some
  external event. In order for this to work, the appropriate logic must be implemented
  in the <code>isReady</code> method of the module. Also, the module must implement
  the <code>AlwaysReady</code> interface. Beyond this, simply develop code that,
  when the external event occures, call the <code>checkMe</code> method of the
  modules execution manager. This functionality is only available for <code>ExecModules</code>.</p>
<p>There are now two jar files instead of one. The infrastructure.jar file contains
  the d2k execution engine and infrastructure. The toolkit.jar contains the D2K
  Toolkit code. There are also now two entry points the differing D2K applications
  distributed. To run D2K in batch mode, run the class &quot;ncsa.d2k.batch.CommandLineD2K&quot;.
  To run the Toolkit, run &quot;ncsa.d2k.gui.ToolKit&quot;.</p>
